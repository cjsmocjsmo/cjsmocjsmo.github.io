				<p class="text-black astro-IQ2FI4XY">I’m excited to share my experience, they excepted the job when no one else would. We had
					several local tree service companies come out and declined to remove them because the
					risk and difficulty . We had 4 very risky tall fir trees that were hanging over our house ,
					up against a fence which adjoined the Neighboring house blocked in by a shed and covered 
					in Ivy vines the size of trees from the ground to the top! They showed up on time as planned 
					and shortly after introductions the crew was geared up and climbing and cutting. We hung 
					out with the crew during the whole process and had a great time learning, watching and 
					laughing through the whole process. I did and will recommend this tree service company 
					to anyone needing trees removed. Professional, experienced, fearless and affordable!"
